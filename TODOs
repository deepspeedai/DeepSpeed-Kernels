How to programmatically figure out the tmp build path?
  * current: build/lib.linux-x86_64-cpython-310/dskernels
  * This is needed as the LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY path in CMake

Allow env variable support to set different compute-caps, currently hardcoded to 8.6
  * we should probably default to native for dev source installs
  * allow support for passing in CC targets for portable dist

Currently hardcoding .so files in MANIFEST, this shouldn't be needed but removing it 
seemed to break the include, just need to debug that further
